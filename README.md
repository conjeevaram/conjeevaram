## Hi, I'm Paras ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo focussed on challenging problems in autonomous robotics, machine learning, and intelligent vision systems.
  - ðŸš™ I'm a core member of the perception team in my school's [self-driving car team](watonomous.ca), working on implementing and optimizing monocular depth estimation features, 3D object tracking, and anomaly detection for autonomous driving
  - ðŸ”§ I'm currently an undergraduate research assistant developing machine learning algorithms to predict short and long term motor health under Professors Sanjeev Bedi and Mahesh Pandey
  - ðŸ¤– I implemented my own [UNET depth estimation model](https://github.com/conjeevaram/Monocular-Depth-Estimation) from scratch, and trained it on the NYUV2 dataset, along with a ton of other cool projects you can find in my repos
